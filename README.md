# QAWeek2Challenge

What was the challenge?

The challenge was to write SQL queries to find information about our database.

How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected the challenge to be difficult as this is the first time I have learned SQL. 

What went well?

The training had helped me to understand a lot of logic behind making queries.

What didn't go as planned?

I found it a bit difficult to understand the correct order of the queries but this is from a lack of understanding of the SQL.

Possible improvements for future challenges

This challenge will push me to further practice on more queries so that I can get used to the syntax and the logic.
